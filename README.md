Week 10 Homework
--------------------------------------

This is an interactive command line app similar to Siri or Alexa!

You can tell it what you want it to do using the following commands (without quotations):

+ "spotify-this-song": Enter a song name and see what Liri gives you back!

+ "movie-this": Enter a movie title and see what Liri gives you back!

+ "concert-this": Enter a band name and see what Liri gives you back!

+ "do-what-it-says": Wildcard! See what happens!


You will have to enter your typical command line prompts first (without quotations):

```
"node liri.js <insert command here>"
```
